# geocoding-api-test
perform some REST api testing on Google geocoding API

This is a mvn project project.
## Preqs
* Java 1.8 SDK
* Maven 3.x
* System Path is able to find `mvn` and `java`
* Git or download this repo

## Execution of the Test cases
* Open open CMD, terminal, or an IDE
* cd to the top-level of the repo that was cloned or download.
* If you are using an IDE, import the project as a Maven project or Java project. For example in VS Code, I opened the top level folder.
* In the terminal or CMD, enter `mvn test`, this should execute the available tests. Of course it will download the necessary dependencies.
* In the IDE, hopefully your IDE has some support for maven. Just run the maven test lifecycle goal.

## Test coverage
I didn't get much of what I wanted to cover.
I was somewhat suprised with the status codes as you could not get a 401 or 403 to be returned. Well at least with the time that I spoent on the assignment <br>
I focused more on the parameters. <br>
I will see if I can add more at a later time <br>
